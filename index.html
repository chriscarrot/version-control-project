        <p>There are almost two thousand Visa and MasterCard transactions are made every single second in the United
          States alone. That is a lot of credit card transactions happening every minute of every day. How do major
          companies and even small businesses ensure that these transactions are secure and that their customer’s
          personal information is not in jeopardy of being stolen by computer hackers or identity thieves. After all,
          in today’s day and age it is easy for someone with some basic understanding of computer hacking to access and
          steal personal credit card information. What kind of policies or standards are in place to protect the
          personal information of customers?
        </p>

        <p>There are two Data Security Standards or (DSSs), the PCI DSS and GDPR. These security standards come into
          play when protecting the personal information of credit card users during and after a transaction. Payment
          Card Industry Data Security Standard or PCI DSS for short was designed by four of the major credit card
          companies in the United States to protect the information of their clients, it is regulated by these
          companies not by the Federal government. On the other hand the GDPR or the General Data Protection
          Regulations, are enforced heavily in the European Union and companies that do not follow the GDPR can be
          heavily fined.

      <p>
        The GDPR standard aims to protect the individual data subject’s rights by regulating the processing of
        personally identifiable information when that individual makes a credit card payment. At the core of the GDPR
        it is designed to protect the privacy of data subjects by preventing the misuse, theft, or unlawful disclosure
        of their sensitive personal data. The GDPR puts the individual in charge of their own personal information and
        allows them to enact specific legal rights to protect and control how and when their personal information is
        used.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand PCI meaning payment card industry standard is intended to prevent merchant data breaches and
        protect cardholders, customers, and the payment ecosystem. To do so, the PCI standard regulates the storage,
        processing, and transmission of cardholder data. At the heart of the PCI DSS it is the duty of credit card
        companies to protect customers better known as cardholders from hackers and cyber criminals. This keeps the
        entire payment ecosystem safe. This data security standard is concerned with the day to day practices of data
        security such as: firewall management, encryption, anti-virus, etc.
