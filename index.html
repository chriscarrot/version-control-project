      <p>
        There are two Data Security Standards or (DSSs), the PCI DSS and GDPR. These security standards come into play when protecting the personal information of credit card users during and after a transaction. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard or PCI DSS for short was designed by four of the major credit card companies in the United States to protect the information of their clients, it is regulated by these companies, not by the Federal government. On the other hand, the GDPR or the General Data Protection Regulations, are enforced heavily in the European Union and companies that do not follow the GDPR can be heavily fined.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GDPR standard aims to protect the individual data subject’s rights by regulating the processing of personally identifiable information when that individual makes a credit card payment. At the core of the GDPR, it is designed to protect the privacy of data subjects by preventing the misuse, theft, or unlawful disclosure of their sensitive personal data. The GDPR puts the individual in charge of their own personal information and allows them to enact specific legal rights to protect and control how and when their personal information is used.

        <h1>PCI DSS</h1>
        <img src="img/compliance-01.png"
          alt="">
        <p>
            The PCI DSS is a compliance standard designed by major companies in the credit card industry and is not enforced by the federal government. It concerns the security and processing of the payment card and the card holder’s personal data only. The PCI DSS covers the storage, transmission, and processing of cardholder data, therefore it is not as extensive as the protection of the GDPR. Merchants who wish to accept credit card payments from these major credit card companies such as Visa and Mastercard are forced to demonstrate compliance. In order to demonstrate compliance companies must be certified by the certification authority known as the PCI council. Compliance is demonstrated through the Attestation of Compliance or the AOC. Banks acquiring the funds from a transaction monitor compliance. Merchants monitor compliance for service providers. Though the PCI is not enforced by the federal government it is an industry standard.

        <h1>GDPR</h1>
        <img src="img/computerHacker.png"
          alt="">
        <p>
            The key differences between the GDPR and PCI DSS are very clear. While the both protect credit card information the GDPR is more extensive in the information it protects. The GDPR is exclusively enforced in countries that are part of the European Union. It concerns the rights and freedoms of citizens in the European Union. It applies to any personal information of a citizen of a state of the EU. It is important to note that it does not matter if your company is in the European Union if your company has processed the credit card information of an EU citizen then your company is bound to the GDPR regulations. This is also true even if that data is not processed in the EU. No matter what if the client resides in the EU the company is required to comply with GDPR. This does not just pertain to credit card information, the company must protect all of the customer's personal information, including their Name, Address, Phone Number, Card Data, ID Number and more.  In the case of the GDPR data controllers and data, processors must demonstrate compliance. It certifies that bodies in the process of being defined. There is no formal method in which companies are forced to demonstrate compliance. Supervisory authorities from the European Union States monitor compliance. Companies found to be out of compliance can be forced to pay significant fines.

        <h1>Compliances</h1>
        <img src="img/creditCard.png"
          alt="">
          <p>While the GDPR has no official way of checking compliance, the PCI or payment card industry has a set of technical and operational standards set forth by the PCI Standards Council. All businesses that store, process, or transmit data electronically are required to follow compliance guidelines.
          </p>

         <p>
            The PCI compliance standards are designed to require merchants and business owners to handle credit card information in a secure manner in order to reduce the likelihood that cardholders might have their sensitive financial information stolen. If companies are not handling client information carefully they could be hacked and clients information could be stolen. 
          
         </p>
          <p>
              Being PCI compliant means that companies consistently comply with or adhere to the guidelines set forth by companies that issue credit cards in the US. Due to the fact that these major credit card companies have an ethical duty to protect cardholder information these standards are very strict. Companies also have an ethical duty to protect client information. Also, it is simply good business to build customer trust. This is easily done by following the guidelines set forth by credit card companies.  
          </p>
          
          <p>
              Many companies that sell and trade internationally seek to be what is known as cross-complaint. Cross compliance is when companies are compliant with both US credit card PCI complaint as well as in compliance with the European Union’s GDPR standards.

              <p>
                  If the customer's information is stolen the customer's credit card information could be used to make fraudulent purchases. Additionally, sensitive information about the person who owns the card could be used in identity theft. Not only is this bad for the company it can result in a loss of reputation among customers. This, in turn, can result in a loss of customers.

              </p>
             <p>
                The company could be forced to pay for financial losses suffered by customers whose information was stolen. These fines can be as much as half a million dollars. Fines such as this could put small businesses out of business. Additionally, companies can be forced to pay an additional $10,000 for every month of noncompliance. Some clients may even seek to take legal action against the company which results in even more expenses. 
              
             </p>
             <p>
                The PCI DSS and GDPR do not just apply to business owners and merchants. It also applies to payment services, banks, software and web developers who build web apps that deal with money or personal finances.
              Some of the many PCI and GDPR requirements include but are not limited to the following. Companies must protect stored cardholder information and must not store unnecessary information. They must also limit who has access to such information on a need to know basis. Each customer should be assigned a unique ID to their information. There are many other factors and compliance standards far too many to list.
             
             </p> 
              <p>
                  Here in the US where companies are required to follow the PCI standard, merchants or companies are required to take the SAQ or the self-assessment questionnaire in order to prove they are in compliance. Proving compliance gives these companies the legal permission to accept payments from major credit card companies. Companies are typically assigned an SAQ based on what type of payment service(s) they use. SAQ A is required for companies that accept payments online or over the phone. SAQ B is required for companies that accept payment via a kiosk or terminal (self-checkout station). SAQ C is required for companies that use a third-party payment application. The assigned SAQ is sent to merchants who are required to complete the form and return it by November 30th of each calendar year. If companies lie or are dishonest on their SAQ documents they could face very serious fines and sometimes legal action against their company depending on the severity of the case.

              alt="">
            <p>
                While the PCI and GDPR standards are important from a business standpoint they also are a part of running an ethical and honest business. This is very important from a business perspective but also it is important from a human trust standpoint. A customer should be able to trust that companies are using their information ethically but also keeping their information safe from hackers. However, some companies are owned by greedy business owners who don’t want to pay to encrypt and protect the information of a client. The process of protecting client information be difficult, expensive, tedious and time-consuming. These dishonest business owners try to find loopholes or try to avoid protecting clients altogether, because of this credit card companies or government institutions have put standards in place to keep business in check.
